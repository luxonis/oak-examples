# Raw Stream

This example project demonstrates how to use the `@luxonis/depthai-viewer-common` package to build a simple custom frontend application for DepthAIv3. It showcases how to stream data to a custom UI that includes a text input, allowing two-way communication between the frontend and the backend application.

This example uses a simple internal Python-based web server. For scenarios involving remote access via WebRTC and support for stream encoding, which requires HTTPS access, it is recommended to use the advanced example [dynamic-yolo-world](../dynamic-yolo-world/README.md).

## Usage

Running this example requires a **Luxonis device** connected to your computer. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/) to setup your device if you haven't done it already.

You can run the example fully on device ([`STANDALONE` mode](#standalone-mode-rvc4-only)) or using your computer as host ([`PERIPHERAL` mode](#peripheral-mode)).

Here is a list of all available parameters:

```
-d DEVICE, --device DEVICE
					Optional name, DeviceID or IP of the camera to connect to. (default: None)
-fps FPS_LIMIT, --fps-limit FPS_LIMIT
					FPS limit. (default: None)
-ip IP, --ip IP       IP address to serve the frontend on. (default: None)
-p PORT, --port PORT  Port to serve the frontend on. (default: None)
```

Before running the example in either mode, you’ll need to first build the frontend. Follow these steps:

1. Install FE dependencies: `cd frontend/ && npm i`
1. Build the FE: `npm run build`
1. Move back to origin directory: `cd ..`

## Peripheral Mode

### Installation

You need to first prepare a **Python 3.10** environment with the following packages installed:

- [DepthAI](https://pypi.org/project/depthai/),
- [DepthAI Nodes](https://pypi.org/project/depthai-nodes/).

You can simply install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running in peripheral mode requires a host computer and there will be communication between device and host which could affect the overall speed of the app. Below are some examples of how to run the example.

### Examples

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will run the example, and you’ll be able to access the frontend in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Standalone Mode (RVC4 only)

Running the example in the standalone mode, app runs entirely on the device.
To run the example in this mode, first install the `oakctl` tool using the installation instructions [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/oakctl).

The app can then be run with:

```bash
oakctl connect <DEVICE_IP>
oakctl app run .
```

This will run the example with default argument values. If you want to change these values you need to edit the `oakapp.toml` file (refer [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/software-v3/oak-apps/configuration/) for more information about this configuration file).
